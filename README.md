# ts-mocha-boilerplate

Boilerplate for typescript projects with mocha, chai and wallaby.js setup.

Just clone this repository and place your typescript code under src directory. The javascript code built will be placed into the built directory.

This is intended for REST services development with node.js, thus the settings in wallaby.js and tsconfig.json correspond to that.
